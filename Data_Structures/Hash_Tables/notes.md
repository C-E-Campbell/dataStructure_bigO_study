# Hash Tables

- send a key into a hash function the store a value at a memory address
- O(1) very fast

- possibility for collisons.

# Map = any data type as the key, also maintinas insertion order.

# Set = only stores values, values have to be unique. good way to get rid of duplicates

Hash Tables vs Arrays
quick lookup, normally o(1), some array methods are o(n)
