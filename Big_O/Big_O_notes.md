# Big O Notes

## What is good code?

- readable
- scalable

### O(n)

- linear time
- time grows linear as the input grows

### O(1)

- constant time
- fast, happens immediately

### O(n^2)

- quadratic time
- not that great, pretty slow

### Rules for simplifying Big O

- Worst Case
  - the slowest possible time for the algo.
- Remove Constants
- Different Terms for inputs
  check how many parameters the algo accepts
- Drop Non Dominants
